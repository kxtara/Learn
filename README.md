# Node.js + TypeScript Backend Learning Project

This project is a **backend learning project** using Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to build a foundation in backend development by practicing **models, controllers, routes, middleware, and database interactions**.

It is designed as a flexible project and can evolve into:
- A **user profile system**
- An **inventory management system**
- Or any CRUD-based application for learning purposes

---

## Features

- PostgreSQL database integration
- TypeScript-based backend for type safety
- Organized structure:
  - `models/` → Database models
  - `controllers/` → Business logic
  - `routes/` → API endpoints
  - `middleware/` → Authentication, authorization, validation, error handling
  - `db/` → Database connection and setup scripts
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Sample `Notes.md` to track learning goals and next steps

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9
- PostgreSQL installed locally
- (Optional) Postman or Insomnia for testing endpoints
